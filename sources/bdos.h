 *  * F5' - set to 1 for "unlocked" mode - other programs can use the file.
 *  * F6' - set to 1 to open the file in read-only mode - other programs can use the file read-only. If both F6' and F5' are set, F6' wins.

 * If A=0FFh, CP/M 3 returns a hardware error in H and B. It also sets some bits in the FCB:
